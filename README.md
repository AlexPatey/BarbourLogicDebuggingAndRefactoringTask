# Barbour Logic - Debugging And Refactoring Task

In order to run the console app, please pull the console app onto your local development machine, and run it in Visual Studio 2022 (or another IDE of your choice).

In order to run the unit tests, you can use the dotnet test command from the Developer Powershell window in VS 2022, or right-click on the DebuggingAndRefactoringTask1.Tests.Unit project (in the "test" folder) and select "Run Tests."

The solution I have provided covers all of the main and bonus requirements provided.

I have provided comments across the code to explain various decisions I have made, and various bug fixes, etc.

I have used the following third-party libraries:
- XUnit for my testing framework.
- FluentAssertions to assert against test results.
